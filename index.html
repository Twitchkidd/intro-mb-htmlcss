					<h3>Summer Treats for Arctic Peeps</h3>
					<h4>by Penny, 2020-07-14</h4>
					<img src="./kylie" />
					<p>
						Long ago, my grandmother Pauline would make these delicious treats
						for us every summer, when the krill and the ice were plentiful and
						our worries few and far between. Mostly killer whales. Still mostly
						killer whales, really. Anyhow, you can substitute vegetarian Kryll
						in for the same amount of krill by weight in any of these recipies. Enjoy!
					</p>

					<h3>Proposition to Install Air Conditioning in Antarctica</h3>
					<h4>by Penny, 2020-07-15</h4>
					<img src="./penny.png" />
					<p>
						The Polar Alliance has released its report on it not being cool
						enough in Antartica this summer, so I'm proposing the use of air
						conditioning to mitigate this problem. There can be no possible
						flaws to this solution, it's perfect. The Polar Alliance will be
						submitting a formal request to the governing bodies to make this
						happen as soon as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank you to all the members of the Polar Alliance for all of their
						hard work, Antartica will be thanking you for generations when we
						are basking in our nice cool climate soon thanks to implementing air
						conditioning.
